[Mod] treecapitator [treecapitator]

I edited Jeja's timber mod to create this mod.  
[There I got the name.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1009577-147-daftpvfs-mods-treecapitator-ingameinfo-crystalwing-startinginv-floatingruins/)  
It works like the timber mod but it destroys the leaves and the fruits, too. Of course, the leaves won't be dropped - only saplings. Hold shift to avoid its function.

[13.04.2015] Added in trees for moretrees, working out getting proper naming for capitating to work.

﻿[14.03.2015] Added sound of a falling tree (taken from there http://www.freesound.org/people/ecfike/sounds/139952/). Made "drop_items" and "drop_leaf" both "true" by default. (mintpick)

TODO:  
* add more trees  
* add more types of trees
* fix mgv7 neighbour tree detection, there sometimes is a sheet removed
* use range_up and range_down for other trees too for greater precision in neighbour detection
